# 📝 Changelog System Guide

The Resource Tracker now includes a comprehensive changelog system that automatically shows users what's new when they visit after an update!

## ✨ Features

- **Version display** in the top navigation next to the organization name
- **"What's New" modal** that appears when users visit after a version update
- **Smart tracking** - remembers what version each user last saw
- **Easy updates** with a simple script and JSON file

## 🚀 How to Update the Changelog

### Method 1: Using the Update Script (Recommended)

Run the interactive script to easily add a new version:

```bash
npm run update-version
```

This will:
1. Show your current version
2. Ask what type of update (patch/minor/major)
3. Let you add changes one by one
4. Update the changelog automatically

### Method 2: Manual Update

Edit `lib/changelog.json` directly:

```json
{
  "currentVersion": "1.3.0",
  "releases": [
    {
      "version": "1.3.0",
      "date": "2025-01-04",
      "title": "New Feature Release",
      "type": "minor",
      "changes": [
        {
          "type": "feature",
          "description": "Added awesome new functionality"
        },
        {
          "type": "improvement", 
          "description": "Made existing features better"
        }
      ]
    }
    // ... previous releases
  ]
}
```

## 📝 Change Types

- **`feature`** ✨ - New functionality
- **`improvement`** 🔧 - Enhancements to existing features
- **`bugfix`** 🐛 - Bug fixes
- **`breaking`** ⚠️ - Breaking changes

## 🎯 Release Types

- **`patch`** (1.2.0 → 1.2.1) - Bug fixes, small improvements
- **`minor`** (1.2.0 → 1.3.0) - New features, non-breaking changes  
- **`major`** (1.2.0 → 2.0.0) - Breaking changes, major features

## 💡 Tips

1. **Always update the version** when making changes users should know about
2. **Keep descriptions clear** and user-friendly
3. **Group related changes** in a single release when possible
4. **Use semantic versioning** consistently

## 📢 Final Step: Update the Main README

After updating the changelog, it is crucial to add the release notes to the main `README.md` file in the project root. This keeps the project's front page up-to-date with the latest changes.

### Release Notes Format

Add a new section to `README.md` using the following format:

```markdown
## 🚀 Release Notes - Version [VERSION_NUMBER]

**Release Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

### ✨ New Features

* [Brief description of a new feature, including what it does and why it's beneficial.]
* [Another new feature, if applicable.]

### 🚀 Improvements

* [Description of an enhancement to an existing feature.]
* [Details about performance improvements, UI/UX updates, or refactoring.]

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* [A summary of a bug that was fixed and the impact on the user.]
* [Another bug fix, if applicable.]
---
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Version tracking**: Each user's last seen version is stored in localStorage
2. **Smart detection**: When current version > last seen version, show modal
3. **Modal display**: Shows all releases since their last visit
4. **User control**: Users can "Got It!" (mark as seen) or "Remind Me Later"

The system automatically handles version comparison and will show users all updates they've missed since their last visit!
