# Resource Tracker

A comprehensive resource management and tracking portal with Discord authentication and role-based access control. Perfect for gaming communities, organizations, and teams that need to track shared resources, inventory, or assets.

Made for Dune: Awakening. Originally forked from `https://github.com/theyetty` and adapted to the specific needs of my guild.

Removed from fork network due to original author repository being deleted, and database/backend changes incompatible with other forks.

## üöÄ Release Notes - Version 4.0.6

**Release Date:** October 2, 2025

### ‚ú® New Features

* **Admin Resource Update Override:** Administrators can now update resource quantities on behalf of other users via a new dropdown in the **"Add/Remove" modal**. The backend API has been updated to accept an `onBehalfOf` parameter, and an audit note is automatically recorded in the reason field for these actions.

### üöÄ Improvements

* **Core Framework Upgrades:** The application has been upgraded to **React 19.2.0** and **Next.js 15.1.1**, bringing the project up to date with the latest versions of these critical frameworks.
* **API Route Handler Adaptations:** Dynamic API route handlers were updated to correctly process **asynchronous parameters**, a new requirement in Next.js 15.
* **Type Definition Streamlining:** The `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` packages were removed, as **React 19 now includes its own type definitions**, simplifying project dependency management.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

* **Congratulations Popup Fix:** Fixed a bug where the **congratulations popup** was not appearing after a resource update. The logic in `ResourceTable.tsx` now correctly uses the `pointsEarned` from the API response to trigger the popup.

*See `lib/changelog.json` for previous update history.*

## üöÄ Free Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying your own instance of the Resource Tracker for free using Vercel and Turso.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

1.  **Node.js**: Version 22.x LTS is required. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Git**: Required for cloning the repository. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3.  **A code editor**: Such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Step 1: Fork and Clone the Repository

1.  **Fork the project**: Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page to create your own copy.
2.  **Clone your fork**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command, replacing `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ResourceTracker.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ResourceTracker.git)
    cd ResourceTracker
    ```

### Step 2: Set Up Discord OAuth

1.  Navigate to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click **"New Application"**.
2.  Give your application a name (e.g., "My Guild's Resource Tracker").
3.  Go to the **"OAuth2"** tab.
4.  Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You will need these later.
5.  Under **Redirects**, add the following URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/discord`. We will update this with our production URL later.

### Step 3: Get Discord Server Details

1.  **Enable Developer Mode** in Discord: Go to `User Settings > Advanced` and turn on "Developer Mode".
2.  **Copy Server ID**: Right-click your Discord server icon and select "Copy Server ID".
3.  **Copy Role IDs**: In your server settings, go to `Roles`, right-click a role you want to configure, and select "Copy ID". You'll need at least one role for basic access. For more details, see the [role configuration guide](./docs/debug-discord-roles.md).

### Step 4: Create a Free Turso Database

1.  Sign up for a free account at [turso.tech](https://turso.tech). The free tier is very generous.
2.  Click **"Create Database"**.
3.  Choose a name (e.g., `resource-tracker-db`) and select the region closest to you.
4.  Once created, copy the **Database URL** (starts with `libsql://`) and generate and copy an **Auth Token**.

### Step 5: Initial Vercel Deployment

1.  Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up with your GitHub account.
2.  Click **"Add New... > Project"** and import your forked repository.
3.  In the "Configure Project" screen, expand the **Environment Variables** section. Add all variables from the table below, **but leave `NEXTAUTH_URL` empty for now.**

| Variable Name          | Value                 | Description                                                              |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`    | *From Step 2* | Your Discord application's Client ID.                                    |
| `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`| *From Step 2* | Your Discord application's Client Secret.                                |
| `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`     | *From Step 3* | Your Discord server's ID.                                                |
| `DISCORD_ROLES_CONFIG` | *See note below* | **Single-line JSON** for role permissions. See [ENVIRONMENT.md](./ENVIRONMENT.md). |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`         | **Leave this blank for now.** | The production URL of your Vercel app.                                   |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`      | *Generate a secret* | Run `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal to create one.              |
| `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`   | *From Step 4* | Your Turso database URL.                                                 |
| `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`     | *From Step 4* | Your Turso database authentication token.                                |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORG_NAME` | *Your choice* | Your community or organization's name.                                   |

> **Important**: For `DISCORD_ROLES_CONFIG`, the JSON must be on a single line. Start with a simple configuration for a single admin role:
> `[{"id":"YOUR_ADMIN_ROLE_ID","name":"Admin","level":100,"isAdmin":true,"canAccessResources":true,"canEditTargets":true}]`

4.  Click **Deploy**.
5.  **Set Node.js Version**: After the first deployment, go to your project's **Settings > General** on Vercel, set the **Node.js Version** to **22.x**.

### Step 6: Configure Production URL

1.  Once the deployment is complete, go to your project's dashboard on Vercel and copy the primary domain (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app`).
2.  Go back to your project's **Settings > Environment Variables**.
3.  Add a new environment variable: `NEXTAUTH_URL` and paste the domain you just copied.
4.  **Redeploy**: Go to the **Deployments** tab, click the latest deployment, and select "Redeploy" from the menu. This ensures the new `NEXTAUTH_URL` variable is applied.

### Step 7: Initialize the Database

1.  **Install dependencies locally**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Create `.env.local` file**: In your local project folder, create a file named `.env.local` and add your Turso credentials:
    ```
    TURSO_DATABASE_URL=your_turso_database_url
    TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_turso_auth_token
    ```
3.  **Push the schema**: This command will create the necessary tables in your Turso database.
    ```bash
    npm run db:push
    npm run db:log-init
    ```

### Step 8: Populate with Sample Data (Optional)

You can add some initial data to see how the application works.

```bash
# For Dune-specific resources
npm run populate-resources-dune
```

### Step 9: Finalize Discord Configuration

1.  Go back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select your application.
2.  In the **"OAuth2"** tab, under **Redirects**, add your production Vercel URL you configured in Step 6:
    `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/discord`

### üéâ You're Done!

Your Resource Tracker is now live! Visit your Vercel URL to sign in with Discord.

    # Example with an Admin and a Member role:
    DISCORD_ROLES_CONFIG=[{"id":"1234567890","name":"Admin","level":100,"isAdmin":true,"canEditTargets":true,"canAccessResources":true},{"id":"0987654321","name":"Member","level":1,"isAdmin":false,"canEditTargets":false,"canAccessResources":true}]

    # NextAuth (generate secret with: openssl rand -base64 32)
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_generated_with_openssl

    # Turso Database (from your Turso dashboard)
    TURSO_DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-database.turso.io
    TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_turso_auth_token

    # Optional: Customize branding for your local instance
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ORG_NAME=Dev Community
    ```
    For a detailed explanation of all variables, see [ENVIRONMENT.md](./ENVIRONMENT.md).

3.  **Set up the database**:
    ```bash
    npm run db:push
    npm run db:log-init
    ```
4.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
