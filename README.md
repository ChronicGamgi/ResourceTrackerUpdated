# Resource Tracker

A comprehensive resource management and tracking portal with Discord authentication and role-based access control. Perfect for gaming communities, organizations, and teams that need to track shared resources, inventory, or assets.

Made for Dune: Awakening. Originally forked from `https://github.com/theyetty` and adapted to the specific needs of my guild.

Removed from fork network due to original author repository being deleted, and database/backend changes incompatible with other forks.

I can certainly create the `changelog.json` entry and the detailed Markdown release notes for version 4.1.1. This release focuses on a major UI overhaul and refactoring to improve maintainability.

## üöÄ Release Notes - Version 4.1.1: Comprehensive Theming System and UI Refactoring

**Release Date:** October 16, 2025

---

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Comprehensive Theming System Implementation
A robust theming system has been implemented across the application using **Tailwind CSS custom properties (CSS variables)**, transitioning away from hardcoded color values.

* **Light/Dark Mode Management:** The system allows for easy and centralized management of light and dark modes across the application.
* **Refactored UI Components:** All major UI components, including modals, navigation, tables, and dashboards, have been refactored to utilize the new theme variables, ensuring a **consistent visual experience** and **improved scalability**.
* **Centralized Definitions:** Color definitions are now centralized in `app/globals.css` and mapped in `tailwind.config.ts`, simplifying future color adjustments and maintenance.

### üöÄ Improvements

* **Smoother Theme Switching:** The theme switching logic was enhanced with a **pre-hydration script** to prevent visual flickering during initial page loads, providing a smoother user experience.
* **Semantic Color Naming:** CSS color variables in `tailwind.config.ts` and `app/globals.css` were refactored for **improved modularity and semantic naming**. Generic variables like `--color-background-modal-content` have been replaced with more descriptive names such as `--color-tile-background`.
* **Consistent Code Style:** **Prettier** and the **Tailwind CSS plugin** were added to the project to enforce a consistent code style. The entire codebase was formatted with the new setup, specifically **reordering Tailwind CSS classes for uniformity**.

## üöÄ Release Notes - Version 4.1.0: Vercel Data Cache, Improved Migrations, and API Stability

**Release Date:** October 10, 2025

---

### ‚ú® Architectural Features

#### Improved Database Migration System

The database migration tracking system has been completely overhauled from a manual, tag-based approach to an **improved, hash-based system**.

- **Simplified Workflow:** The new system simplifies the database workflow for users, who can now handle all subsequent migrations using a single command: `npm run db:migrate`.
- **Integrity and Consistency:** The system now automatically calculates the SHA256 hash of each migration file, ensuring cross-platform consistency.
- **Schema Update:** The database schema now includes a new `global_settings` table and new `tier`/`subcategory` columns in the `resources` table. **These columns are included to support future features** but allow for more granular classification.

#### Vercel Data Cache Implementation

All API routes have been refactored to utilize **Vercel's fetch-based Data Cache**, resulting in significant performance gains and reduced load times.

- **Caching Strategy:** `GET` API routes have been refactored to use a public/internal pattern to leverage this new caching strategy with appropriate revalidation times.
- **Security and Authentication:**
  - Application protection logic was simplified by replacing the old middleware with a lightweight 'include list'.
  - **Fixed a critical 401 error** by ensuring 'cookie' and 'authorization' headers are correctly forwarded in internal API calls when using Vercel Authentication.

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes & Stability

- **Next.js 15 Compatibility:** Resolved persistent build errors by updating all dynamic API route handlers to correctly use the **asynchronous `params` object signature** required by Next.js 15.
- **Data Integrity on Deletion:** Ensured database integrity during resource deletion by updating the `DELETE` handler to also delete associated records from the `resource_history` and `leaderboard` tables. This logic is now safely wrapped in a **database transaction**.
- **Leaderboard Validation:** Added robust input validation to the leaderboard API route, including an allowlist for the `timeFilter` parameter and fallbacks for other parameters to prevent `NaN` errors from invalid input.

| `DISCORD_ROLES_CONFIG`  | _See note below_              | **Single-line JSON** for role permissions. See [ENVIRONMENT.md](./ENVIRONMENT.md). |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`          | **Leave this blank for now.** | The production URL of your Vercel app.                                             |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`       | _Generate a secret_           | Run `openssl rand -base64 32` in your terminal to create one.                      |
| `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`    | _From Step 4_                 | Your Turso database URL.                                                           |
| `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`      | _From Step 4_                 | Your Turso database authentication token.                                          |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORG_NAME`  | _Your choice_                 | Your community or organization's name.                                             |

> **Important**: For `DISCORD_ROLES_CONFIG`, the JSON must be on a single line. Start with a simple configuration for a single admin role:
> `[{"id":"YOUR_ADMIN_ROLE_ID","name":"Admin","level":100,"isAdmin":true,"canAccessResources":true,"canEditTargets":true}]`

4.  Click **Deploy**.
5.  **Set Node.js Version**: After the first deployment, go to your project's **Settings > General** on Vercel, set the **Node.js Version** to **22.x**.

### Step 6: Configure Production URL

1.  Once the deployment is complete, go to your project's dashboard on Vercel and copy the primary domain (e.g., `https://your-project.vercel.app`).
2.  Go back to your project's **Settings > Environment Variables**.
3.  Add a new environment variable: `NEXTAUTH_URL` and paste the domain you just copied.
4.  **Redeploy**: Go to the **Deployments** tab, click the latest deployment, and select "Redeploy" from the menu. This ensures the new `NEXTAUTH_URL` variable is applied.

### Step 7: Initialize the Database

1.  **Install dependencies locally**: From the local pronect folder that you cloned in Step 1:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Create `.env.local` file**: In your local project folder, create a file named `.env.local` and add your Turso credentials:
    ```
    TURSO_DATABASE_URL=your_turso_database_url
    TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_turso_auth_token
    ```
3.  **Run the Database Migration**: This command creates and sets up the database schema.
    ```bash
    # Applies all existing migrations to create the schema and logs them.
    npm run db:migrate
    ```

### Step 8: Populate with Sample Data (Optional)

You can add some initial data to see how the application works.

```bash
# For Dune-specific resources
npm run populate-resources-dune

# For Tier-6 Blueprints
npm run populate-blueprints-dune
```

### Step 9: Finalize Discord Configuration

1.  Go back to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select your application.
2.  In the **"OAuth2"** tab, under **Redirects**, add your production Vercel URL you configured in Step 6:
    `https://your-app-name.vercel.app/api/auth/callback/discord`

### üéâ You're Done!

Your Resource Tracker is now live! Visit your Vercel URL to sign in with Discord.
