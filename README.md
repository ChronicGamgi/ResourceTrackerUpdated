# Resource Tracker

A comprehensive resource management and tracking portal with Discord authentication and role-based access control. Perfect for gaming communities, organizations, and teams that need to track shared resources, inventory, or assets.

Made for Dune: Awakening. Originally forked from https://github.com/theyetty and adapted to the specific needs of my guild.

Removed from fork network due to original author repository being deleted, and database/backend changes incompatible with other forks.

## üöÄ Release Notes - Version 3.2.7

**Release Date:** August 31, 2025

---

### ‚ú® New Features

* **Full Action Controls on Resource Details Page:** The Resource Details page is now equipped with the complete set of action buttons previously only available on the main resource table. Users can now directly "Add/Remove", "Set Quantity", "Transfer", "Set Target", "Edit", and "Delete" resources from the details view, respecting all existing user permissions.

### üöÄ Improvements

* **Responsive Layout for Action Buttons:** The new action buttons on the details page feature a fully responsive layout. They are neatly arranged in a grid that works on both desktop and mobile, ensuring a great user experience on any device.
* **Uniform Button Sizing:** The action buttons now maintain a uniform height and width, even on mobile devices where text wrapping might occur, providing a cleaner and more professional look.
* **Cleaner Mobile Interface:** To optimize for smaller screens, the icons inside the action buttons on the Resource Details page are now hidden on mobile view, providing more space for the text labels.
* **Improved Text Wrapping:** Long text and URLs in the resource description field will now correctly wrap to the next line, preventing horizontal overflow and improving readability on mobile devices.
* **Centered Title:** The 'Resource Details' title is now centered on the page, particularly in desktop view.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

* **Corrected "Transfer" Button Visibility:** Fixed a permission issue on the Resource Details page where the "Transfer" button was only visible to administrators. It is now correctly shown to all users with editing permissions, matching the behavior of the main resource table.
* **Modal Prop and JSON Fixes:** Resolved several issues with modal components and their interaction with the API, including a JSON parsing error, incorrect prop names, and an unnecessary `session` prop.

## üöÄ Release Notes - Version 3.2.5

**Release Date:** August 28, 2025

---

### New Features
* **Improved Activity Chart:** The activity timeline chart on the resource detail page now shows three distinct lines‚Äîone for Deep Desert, one for Hagga, and a total quantity line‚Äîeach with a unique color. The chart's scaling and y-axis labels have been optimized to better display all three data sets. A legend has also been added to help identify each line.

### Bug Fixes
* **Target Column Visibility:** Fixed a bug where the "Target" column was not showing for users who do not have permissions to edit targets.

## üöÄ Release Notes - Version 3.2.4

**Release Date:** August 27, 2025

---

### Key Features
* **Improved Target Quantity Editing:** The inline text input for a resource's target quantity has been replaced with a new modal. The **ResourceTable** component now shows the target as plain text, and a new **'Set Target'** button has been added to both the grid and table views. Clicking this button opens a new **ChangeTargetModal** to set the quantity.
* **User Data Export:** Users with **hasUserManagementAccess** can now export data for any user. A new API route, `app/api/users/[userId]/data-export/route.ts`, handles the export, and the **UserTable** component now includes an **'Export Data'** button for authorized users.

### Improvements & Fixes
* The button for setting quantity has been relabeled from "Set" to **"Set Qty"**.
* The new **"Set Target"** button is styled with an orange color for better visibility.
* The table view's layout has been adjusted: the **"Resource"** column is narrower with text wrapping, and the **"Actions"** column is wider.
* The table layout is now set to `table-fixed` to ensure consistent column widths.
* Action buttons in the table view now have a minimum width of `20` units (`min-w-20`).
* Dependency versions were updated: `@libsql/client` from 0.15.12 to 0.15.14, `@types/node` from 22.17.2 to 22.18.0, and `drizzle-orm` from 0.44.4 to 0.44.5.
* Fixed a bug where `useEffect` in React was missing dependencies.
 
*See lib/changelog.json for previous update history*
